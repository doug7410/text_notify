        Welcome to PijonTxt!
      %p
        PijonTxt is a text communications and marketing service. It offers three distinct features. 
      %ol
        %li Send a text message to an individual. 
        %li Send a text message and add the individual to a text queue.
        %li Send a mass text message to a group.
      %p 
        Here's how each one works
        %ol
          %li 
            %b Send a text message to an individual
            %p 
              This is pretty streight forward. The form shown below is where you will be sending the text messages from. You enter a name, phone number, and message, then press "send now". That person will get the message.  
            %p
              #{image_tag '/assets/images/individual_txt_form.jpg', class: 'img-responsive'}  
          %li 
            %b Send a text message and add the individual to a text queue
            %p This is like #1 but with one added feature. To do this you fill out the form and click "send later". This will send a message to the person imidately and also add them to the queue, so you can easily send them another messge when you're ready. Below is a picture of what the queue looks like.
            %p
              #{image_tag '/assets/images/queue.jpg', class: 'img-responsive'}
          %li 
            %b Send a mass text message to a group
            %p This is where you can really get a lot of added value form this service. You can create groups of customers and send them all text message at the same time. There are two ways to add customers to groups. You can do it manually or ask people to subscribe to the group by telling them to text the group name to PijonTxt's phone number (855-496-5033). Below is a picture of the group text form.
            %p
              #{image_tag '/assets/images/group_txt_form.jpg', class: 'img-responsive'}
        %p
          There are a couple more important feature that go along with the ones above. 
          %ol
            %li
              When you send a new customer a text, their name and phone number will be saved automatically.
            %li
              When you set up your account, you set up default messages, so you don't have to re-type the same message over and over again. 
          %p

        Here's are a couple examples.
      
      %strong Retail store example
      %p  
        Let's say there's a clothing store called "Jenny's Sweater Shop". Jenny can put up a sign in the window saying "text SWEATER to 855-496-5033 to receive advanced notice of special sales". Customers see the sign and text "SWEATER" to the number and join the list. Now Jenny can can collect customers in her PijonTxt account and send them all a promotional message when ever she wants. She can also add new customers to her list as the check out in the store.
      %p
        %b Example promotional message: 
        "From Jenny's Sweater Shop: Come in to the store 1/30/2015 and get half off of everything! Visit www.jennysweaters.com for more details".
      %p 
        Now Jenny has some new customer connections, and a way to contact them with a marketing message, and even directed them to her web site! 

      %strong
        The food truck/restaurant example
      %p
        Let's say there's a food truck called "Jimmy's Taco Shack". When Jimmy takes a customer's order he simply enters their name, cell number, and an optional (but suggested) order number into PijonTxt. The customer will be sent a text that says something like "Thanks for your order, we'll text you when it's ready."
      %p
        The customer will be placed in a queue, and when their order is ready to go, Jimmy clicks a button, sending them another txt letting them know their order is ready. This way the customer is free to leave the truck , instead of having to wait in front of it. 
      %p
        But that's not allâ€¦ the customer is saved in the database and Jimmy can add them to a group. The next time Jimmy's truck rolls into town, say for the Monday Night Food Truck Rally, Jimmy can send all the customers in the group a message letting them know his truck has arrived at the park.

      %strong PijonTxt will work for you!  
      %p
        These 2 examples can be adapted to many other kinds of businesses. For example: dry cleaners, service department at a car dealership or a computer repair shop.

          %strong How do groups work?
          PijonTxt allows you to create groups. You can add customers to those groups and send a message to everyone in the group with one simple action. A group name is a single word, for example: "MIAMI". The group name is unique to your PijonTxt account, so no other user of PijonTxt can have a group called miami. You can have your customers "Add them selves to you group" by telling them to send a text MIAMI to 855-496-5033. That's it! You can also add customers to your account manually and add them to a group.
